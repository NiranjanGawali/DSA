A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

/**
 * Time Complexity:
 * - The algorithm uses binary search, which halves the search space at each step.
 * - Hence, the time complexity is O(log n), where n is the length of the array.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - The space used by the algorithm is constant, as only a few variables are used.
 * - Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
