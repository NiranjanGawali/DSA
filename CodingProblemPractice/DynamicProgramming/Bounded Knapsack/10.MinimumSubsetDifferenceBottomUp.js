Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum. 
If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

Example: 

Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11

Here's the analysis of time and space complexity for the provided code that determines whether a subset of numbers can sum up to a given value.

### Time Complexity

1. **`isSubSetPresent` Function:**
   - This function uses dynamic programming to fill a 2D array `dp` of size `(n + 1) x (sum + 1)`, where:
     - `n` is the number of elements in the input array.
     - `sum` is the target sum.
   - The function iterates over each element and each possible sum, leading to a complexity of \(O(n \times \text{sum})\).

2. **`main` Function:**
   - The `main` function iterates through all sums from `0` to `sum`, calling `isSubSetPresent` for each value, which has a complexity of \(O(n \times \text{sum})\) for each call.
   - This gives a total time complexity of \(O(n \times \text{sum}^2)\) since you call `isSubSetPresent` `sum` times.

3. **Overall Time Complexity:**
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \times \text{sum}^2)\).

### Space Complexity

1. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - The `dp` table has a size of \(O(n \times \text{sum})\) to store results of subproblems.

2. **Auxiliary Space:**
   - The rest of the space used in the algorithm (like variables, arrays for `subSetArr`, etc.) is not significant compared to the `dp` table.

3. **Overall Space Complexity:**
   - Thus, the overall space complexity is \(O(n \times \text{sum})\).

### Conclusion

In summary, the code effectively determines the subset sums using a dynamic programming approach, with a time complexity of \(O(n \times \text{sum}^2)\) and space complexity of \(O(n \times \text{sum})\). 
This approach is efficient for moderate sizes of `n` and `sum`, but can become resource-intensive for larger values.
