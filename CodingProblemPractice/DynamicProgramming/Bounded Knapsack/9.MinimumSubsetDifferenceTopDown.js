Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum. 
If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

Example: 

Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11

Here's a more concise summary of the time and space complexity of the provided code:

### Time Complexity

- **`isSubSetPresent` Function:** 
  - With memoization, the time complexity is \(O(n \times \text{sum})\), where:
    - `n` is the number of elements in the array.
    - `sum` is the target sum (up to the total sum of the array).
  - This is due to the function exploring all unique combinations of `n` and `sum` once.

- **`main` Function:** 
  - It iterates over all possible sums from `0` to `sum`, calling `isSubSetPresent` for each value.
  - This adds an additional factor of \(O(\text{sum})\).
  
- **Overall Time Complexity:** 
  - Combining both functions gives \(O(n \times \text{sum})\).

### Space Complexity

- **Recursive Call Stack:** 
  - The maximum depth of recursion can go up to `n`, leading to \(O(n)\) space for the call stack.

- **Memoization Storage:** 
  - The memoization uses a two-dimensional object to store results for each unique state, resulting in \(O(n \times \text{sum})\) space.

- **Overall Space Complexity:** 
  - Thus, the total space complexity is \(O(n \times \text{sum})\).

### Conclusion

In summary, the code efficiently checks for the presence of subsets that sum to various values using memoization, optimizing both time and space complexities to \(O(n \times \text{sum})\). 
This approach is significantly more efficient than the naive \(O(2^n)\) solution, particularly for larger input sizes.
